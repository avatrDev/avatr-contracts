# Avatr

## Description

Avatr is a reward based NFT aggregator that will operate as a medium for P2P recruitment by tokenizing talent. Every stakeholder (candidates and employers) will create an Avatr, which will be made up of fractionalized NFTs.
An Avatr is a digital representation of the creator’s measured performance in a tokenized form that allows for rewards to be generated for the creator and NFT holders alike. These will be made available to the community via
purchase, referral, or reward. NFT ownership, which is essentially a stake in talent, will be enabled by introducing tokenization as a staple of the recruitment process. NFT values are dynamic in nature and are driven by the
performance of an Avatr; the better the performance, the better the reward for all the holders. This will radically change the way money flows in the employment space, with the workplace community being the most generously
rewarded, not traditional third parties such as agencies, job boards, and advertisers.
